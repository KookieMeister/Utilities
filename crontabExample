# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command
#0 5 * * 6 "path to the file you will run, excluding the "" " > /var/log/updatePi.log #this is the path to a log file that you can define 2>&1 #this line indicates send messages as well as std out messages to the log.

#If this file needs to be run by a particular user, you will need to run the command "crontab -e" and then edit the crontab file that comes up after that command.  If you need to run the command as root, run "sudo crontab -e".

#the entry below is a good example of a crontab entry
#the first number indicates the minute that the entry will run
#the second number is the hour that the script is to occur, so this one will run at hour five
#the third number is the day of the month, this is left with an asterisk to indicate not to use it.
#the fourth number is the number of the month.
#the fifth number is the day of the week, 0 - 6. 0 being sunday and 6 being saturday.

#Below is a good example of an entry written
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
0 5 * * 6 /home/kris/updatePiwPiHole.sh > /var/log/updatePiwPiHole.log 2>&1
# The above sript will run at 5 am every saturday, it will run the script updatePiwPiHole.sh and send all output (including standard out) to /var/log/updatePiwPiHole.log
